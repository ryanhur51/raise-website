        <p>Incorporating AI into educational practices opens up new horizons for developing practice problems and homework that enhance learning and engage students on a personal level. AI can process and analyze large sets of data to create problems that are tailored to the individual needs and interests of students.</p>

        <p>One useful way to optimize AI in education is by creating contextualized word problems. This means that the problems are framed in a context that is familiar to the students, making them more relatable and easier to understand. For example, a math problem about calculating the total cost of weekly groceries can be framed as a rickshaw trip to the local bazaar, using items that students may encounter daily.</p>

        <p>By incorporating students' names and their friends' names into the problems, teachers can make the learning experience more exciting and simultaneously help students understand the practical applications of the concepts.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Creating effective lessons is both an art and a science, requiring careful consideration of students' needs, interests, and learning goals. By contextualizing word problems, educators can make abstract concepts relatable, fostering deeper engagement. Scalable problem sets ensure that lessons are adaptable for diverse skill levels, supporting every learner's progress. Integrating quizzes offers opportunities for active recall and self-assessment, while encouraging students to reinforce their understanding. Finally, incorporating lesson feedback creates a dynamic loop of growth, allowing educators to refine their methods and tailor future lessons.</p>
