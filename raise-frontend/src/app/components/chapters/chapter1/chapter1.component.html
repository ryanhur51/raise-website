    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

    <p>This manual was designed to help teachers integrate generative artificial intelligence into their classrooms to enhance lessons, student engagement, and overall efficiency. Whether you're planning a lesson, grading assignments, or finding new ways to engage your students, AI can be a supportive assistance/guide that is always available. By the end of the manual, teachers will understand how to use AI effectively and find new ways to integrate it in classrooms.</p>

    <h3>What is Generative AI?</h3>
    
    <p>Generative AI (artificial intelligence) refers to artificial intelligence that generates some sort of output, whether that be text, images, videos, etc. Systems such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini are popular examples. Generative AI learns from vast datasets which make it both highly flexible and capable of understanding complex user inputs.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike traditional AI systems that simply follow rules or provide fixed outputs, generative AI can understand nuanced prompts and generate thoughtful, human-like responses. This flexibility makes it especially useful in education, where every student and classroom is different.</p>
    
    <p>While this manual primarily focuses on text-based generative AI tools, it's important to note that these models are evolving rapidly and are beginning to support image, video, and audio inputs as well. Throughout this manual, when we say "AI," we're referring to generative AI unless otherwise specified.</p>

    <h3>How does it Work?</h3>

    <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
    
    <p>Generative AI is revolutionizing the world with no plans of stopping its innovation. In the context of the classroom, students all around the world are using it (whether ethically or not) for their work, writing emails, and summarizing large amounts of text.</p>
    
    <p>While generative AI is not limited to systems that only generate text, the vast majority of our manual will refer to the models that can analyze and generate text. However, even these models are evolving to be able to support analyzing images, videos, and audio.</p>
    
    <p>Rather than viewing generative AI as a threat to the classroom, teachers can utilize it themselves to significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of their class. Research has shown that generative AI can improve productivity as much as 150%. Of course, this depends on how generative AI is used and how well it is being used. One skill that most users need drastic improvement on is prompt engineering.</p>

    <h3>What is prompt engineering? (Framing AI inputs effectively)</h3>
    
    <p>The quality and success of generative AI's responses directly correlate with the quality of the user input. Prompt engineering is a new term that refers to the practice of creating clear and effective prompts to input into a generative AI system in order to get the best output.</p>
    
    <p>AI tools rely on user input to guide their outputs. If a prompt is vague, the response will likely be generic or incomplete. On the other hand, a clear and detailed prompt can result in content that is specific and relevant to the user.</p>

    <h3>Basic tips to Improve Prompts</h3>
    
    <p>Instead of prompting the system to simply "Explain photosynthesis," try "Explain photosynthesis so that a 10-year-old would be able to understand it." The more specific your prompt, the more tailored and effective the AI's response will be. Adjusting the difficulty level and providing details ensures that the output aligns with your audience's needs.</p>
    
    <p>Tailor your prompts to what you need by providing clear context. If you are looking for a lesson plan on photosynthesis, specify the grade level, duration, and teaching style. Whether you need content for high schoolers, interactive activities, or simplified explanations, guiding the AI will result in better, more useful responses.</p>
    
    <p>Specify the format of your outputs to match your needs. If you want a bullet-point summary, a step-by-step guide, or a table comparing concepts, make that clear in your prompt. Structured requests lead to responses that require less revision and make information easier to digest.</p>
    
    <p>Experiment with a generative AI model of your choice to understand how it responds. Each system has its own quirks, strengths, and limitations, which can change over time as updates are released. Testing different prompts and refining them based on the responses will help you maximize the AI's potential for your classroom.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout the manual, we will provide examples of inputs to use that align with the topics we discuss. These examples will help you refine your prompts and get the most out of generative AI in your classroom. Now that we have explored how to create effective prompts, let's take a deeper die on how to create effective lessons using generative AI.</p>
